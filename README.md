BME344 is a control systems course offered in the biomedical systems engineering option, which is one of the eight options in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto.

In this project, my team and I modelled an artificial respiratory system, proposed by professors Doelman & Delawari as part of their undergraduate thesis at TU Delft. We utilized MATLAB and Simulink to model the proposed system, then alter it in a way to design two systems; one that models the behavior of the lungs of a patient suffering from asthma, and another that models the behavior of these lungs due after a possible medication is incorporated into the system.
